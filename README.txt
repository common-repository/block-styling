A simple plugin that tries making Gutenberg's blocks a friendly tool.

== Description ==

This plugin revolutionizes the Gutenberg editing experience by introducing groundbreaking **visible guidelines for blocks** . 
These guidelines, seamlessly integrated into the WordPress backend, serve as visual aids that dramatically enhance the readability and organization of blocks. With these clear visual cues, users can effortlessly identify block edges, alignment points, and content boundaries, leading to an unparalleled level of precision and control. This enhanced visual clarity not only simplifies block manipulation but also elevates the overall user experience, making block editing a breeze.
